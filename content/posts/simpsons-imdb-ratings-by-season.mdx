The wall came down, and about a month later <SimpsonsXRef slug="7g08">the first episons</SimpsonsXRef> of *The Simpsons* aired on the Fox network. For 34 years the show has been locked in a kind of strange timewarp, with characters who never age, while the world around them has changed to be almost unrecognizable. They have outlasted five US presidents (including <SimpsonsXRef slug="babf13">predicting</SimpsonsXRef> and then *still being around for* the end of President Trump), and essentially pre-date the (widespread usage of) the internet.
